# To Start Anything, Start Simple

**TL;DR: To avoid falling into the perfect solution trap, start with the simplest, most frictionless system your brain can come up with**

One of the ways my ADHD and perfectionism join forces is by making it nearly impossible to start things. ADHD makes it hard to start. Perfectionism tells me I shouldn’t even try unless I can do it right. It’s not a productive combo. 

I think ADHD works a lot like Newton's laws of physics: when you're moving, it's hard to stop; but when you're stopped, it's hard to get moving.

What happens with perfectionism is that I end up falling into the Nirvana fallacy [^1]. I don't start things until I know the perfect way to do it.

For example, you decide you want to start reading more. So you go watch videos that give you tips on reading more, and spend hours looking for the perfect book to pick up that you're sure you won't put down. Or, you want to learn a language, so you search what's the best language to learn and what's the best learning method for it. 

Or, you want to start a blog, so you research all possible blog-hosting platforms and end up in a SEO-rabbit hole. (*Definitely* not speaking from personal experience in any of these...).

Here's what's working for me: in order to **get moving** you need to keep it **as simple as possible**. 

Again, let me give you some examples:

- I wanted to start taking notes, so I set up a very complicated system in Notion [^2]. I quickly got overwhelmed with the setup and the overhead necessary to keep the system. Read a book about note-taking, decided to implement Zettelkasten [^3] using Obsidian [^4]. Still, got too lost in the system. Ended up just having all my notes in one big plaintext file [^5]. In this case, I started from a very complex solution, and built it down to a very simple one. This was the catalyst for me to start thinking about simplifying my other systems.
- My company gives us access to Babbel [^6] for language learning, so that we can learn German (a notoriously not easy language to learn). To complement my learning, I decided to, besides the app, try doing language learning exercises with AI, and also watch videos and listen to podcasts in German. I also ended up moving away from their usual plans to do, by myself, the other vocabulary and grammar courses. Once again, I spread myself too thin, and got overwhelmed. I've simplified now, and use only what's available on the app, and I follow their plans. No more need to figure out how to join everything together for each topic. Note that in this case, I went with the solution provided by my company, taking away the mental load of having to choose an app.
- The one thing that has worked for me when it comes to exercising regularly, after years of struggling with it, is to do some 20-30 minutes of youtube yoga workouts at home. I do these almost every day, depending on my energy levels. I have tried various other things, such as Apple Fitness+, various gyms, competitive sports, but this has been the most sustainable habit I've had. Why yoga? Because I used to do it when I was younger, so it was the simplest one to pick up. 

As you can see, the goal here is to create a system that requires as little friction as possible, even if it's not optimal. Optimization of a system *may* come later, if you're really feeling the need for it (example: you're plateuing/need more guidance in your language learning/workouts). But this should be done only *after* you have a strong system to fallback to.
